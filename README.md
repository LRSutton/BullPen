Most of the code that I've written over the past few years has been within walled gardens so not much can be shared. 

In that light, I've started building this small epository of a sample application. For now it is a log repository working with file systems, etc acting as a way for me to stay fresh on file, database, system manipulation, etc.

Note that many files are variant ways of doing the same tasks using different techniques and would not all necessarily be needed in the same application.

The technologies in play here are
1. Java v8
1. Spring v4.x
1. Spring Boot v2.0.2
